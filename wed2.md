#Part 1


##Plots:
How did each filter transform each image?

filter = [ [1, 1, 0], [-2, 1, -2], [1, 0, -1]]

Complexity decreases



#Part 2

What are you functionally accomplishing as you apply the filter to your original array?

•

Why is the application of a convolving filter to an image useful for computer vision?

•

In effect what have you accomplished by applying this filter?

•

Does there seem to be a logic (i.e. maximizing, averaging or minimizing values?) associated with the pooling filter provided in the example exercise (convolutions & pooling)?

•

Did the resulting image increase in size or decrease?

•

Why would this method be useful?
