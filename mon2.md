Specify and train both a multi-class linear regression and a multi-class DNN regression. 

We used the following variables in our regression:

1)highway-mpg

2)num-of-cylinders

3)engine-size

4)horsepower

5)curb-weight

Then, we produced a multi-class linear regression and a multi-class DNN regression.

The multi-class linear regression:
![img_18.png](img_18.png)

This results in both a loss and val_loss above 2.

The DNN-regression:
![img_19.png](img_19.png)

This results in both a loss and val_loss above 2 as well.


Which of the two models produces a better loss metric?
Based on our plot, it appears that the DNN produces a better loss metric; the slope of the linear model was greater than the slope of the DNN model.



Return to the remainder of the variables from the dataset and add additional continuous and categorical features with the intent of improving your loss metric. 


Produce a plot that demonstrates the value of your model.
