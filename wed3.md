Worked with both Liz and Ethan, receiving similar results.

For me in particular, I was having major trouble coordinating the code with the group. Even after having seemingly the same code, the final accuracy rate resulted in a value at 0.01. After class and after reviewing the code again, I was finally able to get results that corresponded with Liz and Ethan.
