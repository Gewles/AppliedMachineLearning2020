### What does each box in the illustration represent?

•

### Are there different paths towards the final concatenation step?

•

### What is occurring at each step and why is it necessary to execute before fitting your model?

•

### Describe the model output



### What is the target for the dataset? How would you assess the accuracy of each model?

•

### Are you using a different metric for each one? Why is this so? What is each one measuring?
