### Some initial hurdles

1) there was initial trouble using gender as a categorical variable expressed as an integer; we had to revamp some of our variables and changed gender into a purely categorical variable divided into the two categories presented through the data: male and female.


2) additionally, our prepared code for today's class lacked bucketized columns, so we used our code from the previous class as a reference, dividing our age data into [20,40,60].


3) for the first few minutes of our preliminary discussion of our data, we were concerned with which of the supplied features we should/would use to make an efficient and accurate model. Ultimately, we dropped the features that were less tangible and harder to interpret and there were still ten features remaining.
