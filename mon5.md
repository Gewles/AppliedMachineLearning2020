How accurately can a model classify, then predict images of animals belonging to ten different categories, ranging from dogs and cats to spiders and butterflies?

### Abstract:

The process of image classification is of particular interest to me; the ability of a computer to classify various pictures into their appropriate categories inspired the above question. Using a similar method to our beans image classification, I would be interested to see if I can create a model that can accurately classify a set of 28000 images (training/testing data) into their respective categories. For this problem, I referenced the Animals-10 dataset, taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10), which will be translated from Italian. I anticipate many obstacles in the preprocessing steps: data cleanup, manipulating the columns to my advantage, dropping values, etc. After these initial hurdles, I anticipate the modeling portion itself to have little difficulty, though I havenâ€™t worked with a dataset this large, so there might be long wait-times for fitting and training the model.
